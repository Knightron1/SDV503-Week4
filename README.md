# SDV503-Week4
What did we learn?
During week 4 we learned how to use if/else statements, switch statements and how to use them both.

Why did we learn it?
This type of code is nessecary when it comes to differentiation between different values/objects. This helps the program decide what to do in specific scenarios and allows for greater customizability.

How does it help?
This helps with coding as it is one of the fundamental building blocks when it comes to designing a full fledged program
